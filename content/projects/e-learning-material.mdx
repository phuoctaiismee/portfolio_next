## Description
E-Learning Material was developed using the Java Swing platform as required by the Ministry of Education and Training to provide teaching materials for school teachers.

## Project requirements:
- The software should run directly from the USB and only function when connected to a USB.
- No data copying is allowed (photos, videos, PDFs).
- Lightweight, easy installation without the need for database management systems like SQL Server.

## Solution:
- Check USB Serial to ensure each USB has a unique serial number.
- Encrypt the entire le and decrypt it only when necessary, creating multimedia viewers for it. 
- Use SQLite

## Feature
- Document management
- Multimedia viewer of images, videos, PDFs
- Add one or more learning materials as a zip file
- Filter by document type
